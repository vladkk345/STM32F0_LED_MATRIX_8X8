# STM32F0_LED_MATRIX_8X8_MAX_7219
Project on the STM32 use CubeMX, Keil 5
This is project for microcontrollers STM32. Code generated from CubeMX in Keil uVision 5 ver. 
The code writed on the C language for control LED matrix, monochrome, red color, 8x8 dots,
embedded in the module with led-driver MAX7219.
In this project realized 3 effects:
- led on full display (64 dots);
- Running text (Right to left);
- The counting numbers (0-9).
Timer, which was generated in the project (in main.c file), not used.
In addition led, embedded on the board STM32F0 Discovery, can used also.
